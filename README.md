# Installation

```bash
npm install -g discid
```

# Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user must be in the [Lanyard Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/lanyard) in order to retrieve information about the user.

```bash
discid [userID]
```

You will need to replace `[userID]` with the ID of the user you are trying to fetch the status of. If you want an guide with images, visit [this section](https://iinter.me/writing/using-discid#how-do-you-find-a-user-id) of my post, otherwise, you can follow these steps.

1. Enable Developer mode by going to **Settings** ‚ûî **Advanced** ‚ûî **Developer Mode**, and check the toggle.

2.  Right click on a user and click the [`Copy User ID`](https://iinter.me/images/using-discid/copy-user-id.png) button.

3. Go back to your command line and run the same command from above, replacing `[userID]` with the ID you copied.

For example, to check the status of the user 'iinter', you can run the following command:

```bash
discid 514106760299151372
```

Depending on what the user is doing, the otuput might return different things. Here is an example of what may be retuned:

```bash
iinter ‚Ä¢ üü¢ Online
Listening To: Duvet by b√¥a on Twilight
Platform: Desktop
Avatar URL: https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/514106760299151372/d14e90a16144987f53f5a3700aacc934.png
```

These are returned because the status of the user is set to **'Online'** and they are listening to the song **'Duvet'** by **'b√¥a'** at the time the command was ran.
